# Skeleton-based-action-recognition-model
Skeleton-based action recognition by using a Double-feature Double- motion Network (DD-Net).
Recent skeleton-based action recognition approaches achieve great improvement by using RNN
models. Currently these approaches build an end-to-end network fromcoordinates of joints to class

categories and improve accuracy by extending RNN to spatial domains. First, while such well-
designed models and optimization strategies explore relations between different parts directly from

joint coordinates, we provide a simple universal spatial modeling method perpendicular to the
RNN model enhancement. Specifically, according to the evolution of previous work, we select a
set ofsimple geometric features, and then separately feed each type of features to a 3-layer LSTM
framework. Although skeleton-based action recognition has achieved great success in recent years,
most of the existing methods may suffer from a large model size and slow execution speed. To

alleviate this issue, we analyze skeleton sequence properties to propose a Double-feature Double-
motion Network (DD-Net) for skeleton-based action recognition.
